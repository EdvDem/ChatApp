-Introduced myself to GitHub Copilot and used it for the following:
-Centered the profile picture box
-Did some other minor UI changes to make it look better
-Made it so the color styles are not coded individually but rather using a separate theme file where I can tweak all the colors at the same time
-Made the profile picture box also clickable to do the same thing as the Upload button
